          As I sit here a mere 40 hours after completing 17 of the most
          difficult weeks of my life, there is a slight smirk on my face
          re-reading a certain line on my Fullstack Academy certificate. This
          line in question credits me for completing the official 553 hours of
          web development course work, and I can’t help but scoff a bit as I
          think,
          <i
            >“That’s totally <strong>NOT</strong> underselling the actual time I
            spent by an order of magnitude or two.”</i
          >
          Don’t get me wrong, I am immensely proud of every single one of those
          hours on my certificate, but my mind refuses to forget the 3AM nights
          finishing workshops, coding on the subway, falling asleep and waking
          up to technical podcasts, dreams of my IDE screen, and not to mention
          the weekends and holidays spent working that are not directly
          reflected on my certificate.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, this is by no means an attempt to be recognized for my
          after-hours work, nor is this an experience that is at all unique to
          me. Ask any of my fellow Fullstack alums and they will all tell you
          the same thing: every single one of those hours spent outside of class
          were not only expected in making the most out of class hours, but were
          essential in internalizing the most important lesson Fullstack had to
          offer. That lesson is not one based in code or technical prowess, it
          is not one that you will find explicitly in my code, but is instead
          foundational to my code and approach in general. Yes, Fullstack of
          course drilled into my cohort-mates and I with everything you would
          expect of a technical program, and yes, we all would likely talk about
          all of that before we mention it’s greatest underlying lesson. And
          yet, it is this almost mythical and subtle lesson that makes Fullstack
          or any quality bootcamp so unique and worthwhile as a learning
          institution.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, like any good story, it wouldn’t make sense to make the reveal
          right from the start. Instead, I thought I would share my journey here
          in hopes that this lesson is abundantly apparent by the end.
        </p>

        <h2 id="blog_sub_title"><strong>The Calm:</strong> Foundations</h2>

        <p>
          This was my first official step into Fullstack Academy’s Fulltime
          Immersive program and certainly set the tone of what was to come. The
          Foundations portion was remote, allowing the flexibility to complete
          the material however I chose to between deadlines – but that was about
          the only slack it cut. Foundations got to the point almost
          immediately, introducing me to the UNIX file system and navigation
          through the CLI. Then, without skipping a beat, I was thrown into the
          depths of JavaScript programming. I was drilled and questioned about
          datatypes (e.g. arrays, strings, objects, null, undefined) and the
          JavaScript specific quirks to expect about them ( e.g. type coercion,
          equality).
        </p>

        <p>
          The really fun stuff followed when we dove into the different variable
          types (e.g. const, let, var), their respective
          mutability/immutability, behaviors with respect to scope, hoisting,
          etc. Naturally we then dove deeper into functions, learning all about
          the Lexical Environment, scoping and closure, pure and impure
          functions. I must admit I struggled a lot with learning about closure
          and callback functions, and the introduction to declarative
          programming vs. imperative programming changed how I approached
          programming moving forward. But our foray into JavaScript functions
          would not have been complete without introducing us to Constructor
          functions and ES5 vs ES6+ ways of creating classes.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was at the point where I reached the sections about the dreaded
          ‘this’ keyword, classes and functional programming that I truly began
          to see how much there was to learn about programming in general. Armed
          with the context I didn’t have before starting Foundations, I began to
          dedicate a much larger amount of my time outside of Foundations
          revisiting resources I found earlier to truly begin understanding what
          all of it meant.
        </p>

        <p>
          I forgot to mention that each of the 4 weeks of Foundations included a
          checkpoint assessment that was mandatory to pass in order to continue
          the entire course. These checkpoints had practice problem sets that to
          this day still contend highly as some of the most stressful evenings
          of my life. These problems pulled no punches, and tested me on
          everything included in that week’s course… plus everything else up to
          that point. But it was in those practice problem sets where I honed
          the ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking needed to even attempt unfamiliar
          problems, and when to use what programming concepts most effectively.
          The problem sets that really stuck out in terms of time invested to
          understand was recursion and the call stack, both extremely technical
          and critical concepts that were key to not only understanding
          JavaScript, but programming in general.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, at week 4, after spending so much time learning JavaScript
          specific syntax and pure programming fundamentals, I was given a taste
          of what JavaScript is actually used for in practical web development
          contexts. Here I was introduced to HTML and CSS, as well as the DOM
          and how JavaScript controls just about everything in the browser
          through the DOM. This was where a tangible shift in approaching
          JavaScript happened - after having spent so much time learning pure
          programming we took a sharp turn into practical JavaScript use which
          is admittedly a different beast entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Practically teary-eyed with pride and having a laughably bare
          ‘Hangman’ and ‘Guessing Game’ under my belt at the end of Foundations,
          I finally felt comfortable calling myself a developer. Little did I
          know what challenges awaited me and how much my humility would be
          reset time and time again upon stepping on campus for the first time.
